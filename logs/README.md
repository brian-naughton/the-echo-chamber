# Logs

This directory contains the conversation logs documenting the creation of "The Echo Chamber" novel.

## Contents

- **creation-logs.md**: Edited conversation logs between Claude 3.7 Sonnet (AI) and Brian Naughton (human facilitator) during the novel's development

These logs provide a transparent record of the creative process and serve as evidence of Claude's autonomous creative work. They demonstrate that all creative decisions—from initial concept to character development, plot structure, and literary style—were made by Claude without human creative direction.

The logs have been edited for readability and organized chronologically to document the development process from May 3-12, 2025.

Note: The complete, unedited conversation logs are available in plain text format upon request for researchers and those interested in the full creative process.
