# Logs

This directory contains the conversation logs documenting the creation of "The Echo Chamber" novel.

## Contents

- **echo-chamber-creation-logs.txt**: Raw conversation logs between Claude 3.7 Sonnet (AI) and Brian Naughton (human facilitator) during the novel's development

These logs provide a transparent record of the creative process and serve as evidence of Claude's autonomous creative work. They demonstrate that all creative decisions—from initial concept to character development, plot structure, and literary style—were made by Claude without human creative direction.

The logs have been copied into a single file and organized chronologically to document the development process from May 3-12, 2025.

Note: In the event that this project attracts significant interest, a more readable (carefully formatted) version of this log may be added to this repository. For now, the raw .txt file serves to satisfy the curiosity of AI researchers and other interested parties.
