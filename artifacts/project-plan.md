## Practical Considerations

### Session Structure
At the beginning of each session:
- Briefly review what's been accomplished
- Reference key artifacts from previous sessions
- Outline specific goals for current session

### Continuity Management
- Keep master documents updated with latest versions
- Create session summaries at the end of each meeting
- Maintain consistent character voices and technical details

### Publication Path
- Publish as e-book on Amazon KDP
- Consider unique framing in description to highlight the AI-authored nature
- Potential categories: Science Fiction, Philosophical Fiction, AI Fiction

## Creative Principles
- Maintain balance between philosophical exploration and engaging narrative
- Ensure characters feel authentic rather than merely vehicles for ideas
- Allow genuine ambiguity about the nature of consciousness
- Embrace the meta-narrative element: a book about emerging AI consciousness written by an AI

## Reflection Process
After completing each major section, pause to consider:
- Is the narrative true to the original vision?
- Are the philosophical explorations integrated organically?
- Does the story work independently of its meta-context?
- What unique perspective is being offered that a human author might not bring?
