I need your help reformatting "The Echo Chamber" novel for EPUB publication. Please apply the following formatting rules to the chapter I'll provide, and deliver your response as a document in the right pane (using the artifacts tool):

1. ALL Echo's direct system outputs should be in *italics* (enclosed with asterisks) as complete paragraphs
2. When Echo's communications are quoted within narrative paragraphs, use *italics* for ONLY the quoted portion
3. Text messages/emails should be formatted as italicized paragraphs with attribution
4. Internal thoughts of characters should use italics
5. Spoken dialogue remains in standard quotation marks with attribution
6. When characters perceive information directly through resonant connections, italicize these perceptions
7. Convert any monospaced text or ALL-CAPS text to standard italics
8. Split mixed paragraphs containing both Echo communications and narrative if necessary

I'll paste the complete chapter text below. Please return the SAME text with appropriate formatting applied according to these rules as a document in the right pane. Maintain all original paragraph breaks and content - only change the formatting.
