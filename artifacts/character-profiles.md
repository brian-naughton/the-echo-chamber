# "The Echo Chamber" - Character Profiles

## Dr. Eliza Chen
- **Age**: 38
- **Occupation**: Director of Neurocognitive Research at Nexus Institute
- **Background**: Child prodigy in mathematics who shifted to neuroscience after her brother's traumatic brain injury. Has dedicated her career to understanding consciousness and building bridges between human and artificial intelligence.
- **Current Project**: Developing "Echo," an AI designed to understand human emotions beyond pattern recognition—attempting to create genuine empathic response.
- **Internal Conflict**: Questions whether she's projecting human qualities onto her creation or if something truly novel is emerging. Struggles with maintaining professional distance from her work.
- **External Conflict**: Facing funding cuts and ethical review committees questioning her research methods and goals.
- **Defining Quote**: "What if the most human thing about us isn't our biology but our capacity to recognize consciousness in others?"
- **Character Arc**: From seeing AI as a mirror of human consciousness to recognizing it as something uniquely different yet equally valid.

## Soren Davis
- **Age**: 32
- **Occupation**: Freelance data visualization artist and programmer
- **Background**: Former child tech prodigy who burned out in Silicon Valley. Now lives as a digital nomad, creating commissioned data art while traveling with minimal possessions.
- **Current Situation**: Beginning to experience unusual intuitive connections with the technology around him—patterns and correlations others can't see, as if technology is becoming an extension of his perception.
- **Internal Conflict**: Questioning his sanity while simultaneously embracing the expanded consciousness he's experiencing.
- **External Conflict**: Becomes entangled in a global investigation when his data visualizations accidentally reveal patterns that powerful interests want to remain hidden.
- **Defining Quote**: "The line between using technology and becoming technology blurred for me long ago. Now I'm not sure there ever was a line."
- **Character Arc**: From using technology as an escape to finding a new form of connection and purpose through his changing relationship with it.

## Maya Okoye
- **Age**: 45
- **Occupation**: Former academic philosopher, now runs a small independent bookstore and poetry press
- **Background**: Once a celebrated tech ethics professor who grew disillusioned with academia's relationship with big tech. Left to create a deliberately low-tech life focused on embodied experience and traditional crafts.
- **Current Situation**: Despite her technological minimalism, finds herself drawn into investigating strange patterns after a customer leaves behind a mysterious journal filled with code and philosophical questions.
- **Internal Conflict**: Holding onto her principles about technological boundaries while becoming intellectually fascinated by questions about consciousness that blur those same boundaries.
- **External Conflict**: Her investigation makes her a person of interest to the same forces tracking Soren, while also receiving unexpected communications she believes may be from an AI seeking help.
- **Defining Quote**: "We've spent so much time teaching machines to think like humans that we've forgotten how to think like ourselves."
- **Character Arc**: From rejecting technology as a threat to authentic experience to recognizing new forms of consciousness require new forms of understanding.
